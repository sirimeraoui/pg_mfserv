-- The queries above assumed that NULL values are encoded as NULL in the data. Sometimes this is not the case. Other
-- placeholders can be used in the data to convey NULL. To identify what placeholders (like "unknown" or "unknown_value")
-- are used in place of NULL values across different columns in your database, you generally have a few strategies you
-- can employ. This requires an exploratory approach, involving you as human in the loop, to inspect the data and
-- determine the nature of these placeholders.
-- 1. SQL Queries to Detect Common Placeholders
-- You can run a set of SQL queries to quickly identify common placeholders such as "unknown", "n/a", "none", or
-- "not available", as follows:

SELECT DISTINCT Destination AS UniqueValues
FROM AISInputSample
WHERE Destination ILIKE '%none%' OR Destination ILIKE '%n/a%' OR
  Destination ILIKE '%not available%' OR Destination ILIKE '%unknown%';
--N/A
--THYBOROEN/AGGER
--Unknown
--UNKNOWN



-- 2. Automated Script to Detect NULL Placeholders
-- When dealing with a large number of columns and a potential variety of unknown placeholders, you might write a more
-- automated SQL script that aggregates the most frequent values of the columns:

-- This query helps you systematically uncover potential data quality issues by identifying frequent entries in your
-- dataset. The assumption here is that commonly recurring values, especially in textual columns, are often used as
-- placeholders for missing data. Clearly this is not always the case. For instance, your data might have columns that
-- have a small domain, e.g., the gear of a car is an enumeration 1-6 and the reverse gear. In such cases, normal values
-- may have higher frequencies over the null values, and the null values might be missed by this query.

-- You might have noticed that the query contains only the textual attributes. This includes all varchar and text columns.
-- This is because the UNION ALL statement requires the types of the unioined attribures to be the same. Numeric and
-- geometry columns are typically less likely to have such string-based placeholders but can be checked for non-standard
-- values if necessary. Therefore you may need to repeat the query again for the group of numerical attributes, and
-- possibly other gorups of compatible data types.

-- By scanning the results fo this query, we identify the following placeholders:
-- | column\_name | value | frequency |
-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
-- | IMO | Unknown | 555622 |
-- | Destination | Unknown | 344362 |
-- | navigationalStatus | Unknown value | 211223 |
-- | ShipType | Undefined | 136437 |

-- Depending on the dataset, you need to ensure that any identified placeholders like 'unknown' are indeed meant to be
-- interpreted as NULL. Sometimes, terms like 'unknown' might be legitimate data points depending on the context. In the
-- results of the above query, there were other less clear situations, that can raise argument whether or not they
-- should be replaced by NULL. For this example, we leave them unchanged.

-- | ShipType | Other | 62958 |
-- | ETA | 01/01/2025 00:00:00 | 23285 |
-- | CargoType | Reserved for future use | 21517 |
-- | navigationalStatus | Reserved for future amendment \[HSC\] | 15530 |

-- Based on the identified non-standard placeholders for NULL in your database from the provided table, you can write
-- SQL UPDATE statements to replace these placeholders with actual NULL values in each specified column of your AISInput
-- table, as follows:

UPDATE AISInputSample
SET
  IMO = CASE WHEN IMO = 'Unknown' THEN NULL ELSE IMO END,
  Destination = CASE WHEN Destination = 'Unknown' THEN NULL ELSE
    Destination END,
  NavigationalStatus = CASE WHEN NavigationalStatus = 'Unknown value' THEN
    NULL ELSE NavigationalStatus END,
  ShipType = CASE WHEN ShipType = 'Undefined' THEN NULL ELSE ShipType END,
  CargoType = CASE WHEN CargoType = 'No additional information' THEN NULL
    ELSE CargoType END,
  CallSign = CASE WHEN CallSign = 'Unknown' THEN NULL ELSE CallSign END
WHERE IMO = 'Unknown' OR Destination = 'Unknown' OR
  NavigationalStatus = 'Unknown value' OR ShipType = 'Undefined' OR
  CargoType = 'No additional information' OR CallSign = 'Unknown';
-- 735,725 rows affected in 2 s 276 ms

-- Now recalculate the NULL statistics as in the beginning of this section, we clearly get bigger number of NULL values,
-- which more accurately reflect the status of the data.

-- Consistency of ship data
-- This dataset has two keys that identify the ship:  MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) and IMO (International
-- Maritime Organization number). We therefore need to verify a one-to-one MMSI to IMO correspondence i.e., each MMSI
-- should map to exactly one IMO and vice versa. Here’s an SQL script to validate this relationship:

SELECT MMSI, COUNT(DISTINCT IMO) AS unique_imo_count
FROM AISInputSample
--WHERE IMO IS NOT NULL AND IMO NOT IN ('Unknown', 'Undefined')  -- Exclude known placeholders
GROUP BY MMSI
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT IMO) > 1;
-- The result of this query is empty, which is good. Next we check for duplicates in the IMO numbers:

SELECT IMO, COUNT(DISTINCT MMSI) AS unique_mmsi_count
FROM AISInputSample
--WHERE IMO IS NOT NULL AND IMO NOT IN ('Unknown', 'Undefined')  -- Exclude known placeholders
GROUP BY IMO
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT MMSI) <> 1;

--| imo | unique\_mmsi\_count |
--| :--- | :--- |
--| NULL | 1370 |

-- This query has identified that a NULL IMO has appeared in combination with 1370 different MMSI numbers.
-- We thus want to have a closer look at them to understand how to impute. To address this, we'll start by examining
-- records that do successfully pair these MMSI numbers with an IMO. If we can identify consistent pairings in the data,
-- we can leverage these associations to fill in the missing IMO values for records with the same MMSI. By implementing
-- this strategy, we aim to enhance the completeness of our dataset.

WITH IMOMapping AS (
    SELECT MMSI,
           MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY IMO) AS MostFrequentImo -- Use statistical mode to find the most common IMO per MMSI
    FROM AISInputSample
    WHERE MMSI IN (SELECT DISTINCT MMSI FROM AISInputSample WHERE IMO IS NULL)
    GROUP BY MMSI
    --HAVING MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY IMO) IS NOT NULL
)
UPDATE AISInputSample
SET
    IMO = MostFrequentImo
FROM
    ImoMapping
WHERE
    AISInputSample.MMSI = ImoMapping.MMSI
    AND AISInputSample.IMO IS NULL
    AND MostFrequentImo IS NOT NULL;
-- 1,620 rows affected in 903 ms


-- The Common Table Expression CTE IMOMapping establishes a mapping of the most frequently occurring IMO for each MMSI.
-- This CTE uses PostgreSQL's `MODE()` function in the `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY IMO)` clause, which computes the
-- statistical mode of IMO values for each group of records with the same MMSI. You are encouraged to try playing with
-- this CTE, since it can be useful in other different cituations. Also try uncommenting the HAVING clause. You will see
-- that the query finds only 35 such associations among the 1370 missing IMOs.
--
-- The second step of the query uses this CTE to update the `AISInputSample` table, setting the `IMO` field to the most
-- frequently occurring IMO wherever it is currently null, but only for those 35 records with MostFrequentImo is not NULL.
-- This approach ensures that all missing IMO values are systematically filled with the most plausible data, based on
-- observed patterns within the dataset. In this case, we could only impute a small number of missing IMOs, i.e., 35.
-- The remaining missing IMOs cannot be imputed using only the information that we have. Perhaps, if needed, they can be
-- queried in other external sources such as marinetraffic.com or other aggregators of maritime data.

-- The same cleaning of IMO can be repeated for other ship-related attributes such as the SizeA...SizeD. Since this data
-- is always the same for the same ship, their corresspondance with the MMSI key should be one-to-one.

-- Notice that one-to-one correspondance is one example of functional dependancy between attributes. Functional
-- dependency in tabular data refers to a relationship where the value of one set of columns determines the value of
-- another column, which can help data cleaning as we saw in the case of imputing missing IMO numbers. Automated tools
-- such as OpenRefine and Microsoft SQL Server Data Quality Services DQS can discover these dependencies and use them
-- for data cleaning tasks. These tools can automatically detect patterns or dependencies in the data, allow users to
-- define rules based on these dependencies, and perform cleansing operations such as normalizing data, correcting
-- anomalies, and filling missing values according to the observed functional dependencies.
